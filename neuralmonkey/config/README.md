# Configuration

Experiments with NeuralMonkey are configured using configuration files which
specifies the architecture of the model, meta-parameters of the learning, the
data, the way the data are processed and the way the model is run.

## Syntax

The configuration files extends syntax of INI files. INI files contain
_key-value pairs_, delimited by an equal sign (`=`) with no spaces around.
Traditionally, everything on the right side of the equal sign is interpreted as
a string. The key-value pairs can be grouped into _sections_. Section starts
with its header which consists of the section name in square brackets.
Everything below the header is considered a part of the section. The files can
also contain comments starting with semi-colons (`;`).  You can find more
details on INI syntax, e.g., on the corresponding [Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).

The configuration introduces several additional constructs for the values.
There are both atomic values, and compound values.

The atomic values are:

* booleans: literals `True` and `False`

* integers: strings that could be interpreted as integers by Python (e.g.,
  `1`, `002`)

* floats: string that could be interpreted as floats by Python (e.g., `1.0`,
  `.123`, `2.`, `2.34e-12`)

* strings: string literals in quotes (e.g., `"walrus"`, `"5"`)

* Python names: string literals without quotes which are neither booleans,
  integers and floats (e.g., `neuraLmonkey.encoders.SentenceEncoder`)

* section references: string literals in angle brackets (e.g., `<encoder>`),
  section are later interpreted as Python objects

On top of that there are two compound types syntax from Python:

* lists: comma-separated in squared brackets (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`)

* tuples: comma-separated in round brackets (e.g., `("target", <ter>)`)

We also require to have all key-value pairs in sections.

## Interpretation

Each configuration file contains a `[main]` section which is interpreted as a
dictionary having keys specified in the section and values which are results of
interpretation of the INI file values.

Both the atomic and compound types taken from Python (i.e., everything except
the section references) are interpreted as their Python counterparts. The
section references are interpreted as references to objects which are results
of section interpretation.

Every section needs to contain key `class` with a value of Python name which is
a callable (e.g., a class constructor or a function). The other keys are used
as named arguments of the callable.
